	The dataset was preprocessed prior to fitting the model. Exploratory data analysis and data cleaning was performed. Feature selection was performed. Unnecessary features were removed. An appropriate scaler was used to scale the appropriate data. The data was separated into training and testing data. 
	The model parameters were fitted and tuned. Two models were trained and tested. Gridsearch was used for both models to tune model hyperparameters.
