	The dataset was preprocessed prior to fitting the model. Exploratory data analysis and data cleaning was performed. Feature selection was performed. Unnecessary features were removed. An appropriate scaler was used to scale the appropriate data. The data was separated into training and testing data. 
	The model parameters were fitted and tuned. Two models were trained and tested. Gridsearch was used for both models to tune model hyperparameters. The models were compared. Evaluation metrics were used to compare the models. The best model was saved. 
	The training data score for my linear model is 0.846. The testing data score for my linear model is 0.842. The training data score for my logistic model is 0.848. The testing data score for my logistic model is 0.844. When comparing the scores between the two models, they are very similar. For my linear model, when I calculated the best score by printing (grid.bestscore), I got a score of 0.871. For my logistic model, when I calculated the best score by printing (grid.bestscore), I got a score of 0.878.
	I feel like both models are good enough to predict new exoplanets. Both models are using the Gridsearch function. Having more data over a greater period of time would make my model better at predicting new exoplanets. Trying out other machine learning algorithms would also make my model better at predicting new exoplanets. Doing more comparisons between training data and testing data would also make my model better at predicting new exoplanets.
	I learned a lot about machine learning while completing this assignment. I learned how to use a scaler to scale data. I learned how to fit and tune model parameters. I learned how to separate data into training data and testing data. Machine learning is a very important skill to know as you are able to analyze a lot of things if you understand machine learning. I feel like machine learning is a very useful skill to know for the workplace.
